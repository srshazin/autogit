# AutoGit

A CLI tool to automate common git actions.

## Installation

<!-- ### Using PIP
Use directly `pip install agit`

    However, please note that pip installation will not provide the most recent version of autogit and may contain deprecated contents. It's always recommended to use `this` repo to install autogut -->

### Building From Source

Building from source is always the recommended option to install as you get the latest changes. Building from source is easy. You need to have `git` installed on your system.

Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dev5h/autogit.git
```

Then `cd autogit`

After doing that just run

```bash
pip install .
```

If you're lazy just copy the snippet and paste in your terminal

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dev5h/autogit.git &&
cd autogit &&
pip install .
```
