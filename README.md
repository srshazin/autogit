# AutoGit
A CLI tool to automate common git actions.

## Installation
### Using PIP
Use directly `pip install agit`

    However, please note that pip installation will not provide the most recent version of autogit and may contain deprecated contents. It's always recommended to use `this` repo to install autogut

### Building From Source
Building from source is always the recommended option to install as you get the latest changes. Building from source is easy. You need to have `git` installed on your system. 

Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dev5h/autogit.git
```
Then `cd autogit`

After doing that just run 
```bash
pip install .
```

If you're lazy just copy the snippet and paste in your terminal

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dev5h/autogit.git &&
cd autogit &&
pip install .
```
